Hello! This is the server piece to the Giant Machines take home. This should be run in tandem with the client to provide the best experience. 

Because there is no sensitive information, I have included the connection string directly, but I cannot stress enough how this should be put in an env file usually.

The largest dependency is the csv parser that I downloaded to help facilitate easier csv parsing.

The build environment is MacOS for this server as well.

=====Running instructions======
Before running for the first time, make sure to run "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
Afterwards, go ahead and run "npm start" to start the server up.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and review my code, I hope that it is up to Giant Machines's standards!
